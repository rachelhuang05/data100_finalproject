                <p> Over the past fifty years, the effects of climate change have accelerated at an unprecedented pace.
                    These consequences can be seen in coastal California, where rising sea levels due to global warming has submerged
                    a large amount of land, leading to a decrease in available land for housing. As a result, the demand for housing
                    has increased, and housing prices consequently increased. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the rapidly growing competition for housing in coastal California, the U.S. dollar has steadily
                    increased since the early 1970s. The dollar's value has inflated by about seven times over the past fifty years,
                    further adding to the inaccessability of the housing market. Partly as a result, the minimum wage in California
                    is higher than any other state, recently being raised to $16.00 as of April 1, 2024. Some cities, such as
                    San Francisco, have even raised their minimum wages above $18.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a consequence of this, other amenities in California have seen their prices spike recently. Some residents
                    have reported gas prices as high as $7.29/gal, almost twice the national average. In addition to gas, fast
                    food companies have began to gouge prices, with a Chipotle burrito in coastal California reportedly being $10.

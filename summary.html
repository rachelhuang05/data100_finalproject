                <p>The effects of climate change throughout the entire world
                have continued to worse as time goes on. This can be especially seen in the state of 
                California from 1975-2023, where increased temperatures have decreased the amount of available land for 
                housing. This is because increased temperatures have been making ice sheets melt faster, and since
                California is a coastal state, the impact of the resultant rising sea levels on its housing prices
                is especially apparent. There is less available real estate, so homebuyers are willing to pay 
                more for what is available. This means that sellers are able to raise their prices above what their
                property is actually worth.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, this correlation between California's temperature and housing prices should
                    take into account the inflation of the US dollar. The US dollar has inflated by a total of over
                    600% during this time period of 1975-2023, which means that the dollar amounts of commodities
                    have risen, even if their value has not, because more money is needed to buy the same amount of 
                    something has inflation increases. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    California's increasing housing prices are causing a housing shortage, which is only one of the
                    many negative effects of climage change. Climate change has already
                    greatly damaged our environment, and by extension, humanity, and if the world is to 
                    mitigate the negative effects of climate 
                    change in the future and try to slow it down, individuals will have to become more aware of how they
                    consume their resources, so that society as a whole can be kinder to the environment.

                    <h3>Increased temperatures due to climate change lead to:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Higher likelihood of forest fires</li>
                        <li>Greater electricity usage</li>
                        <li>Decreased air quality</li>
                        <li>Increased sea levels due to melting glaciers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Increased sea levels decrease the amount of available land for housing;
                        Californiaâ€™s coastal sea levels have increased by almost 8 inches in the
                        past century, and those sea levels are estimated to rise another 20-55 inches by 2100.

                </p>
                <h3>
                    Climate change has decreased the amount of available land for housing in California. Thus, people are 
                    willing to pay higher prices for housing; as a result, realtors can raise prices as demand increases.
                </h3>

                    temperature from 1975-2023.

                        <li>higher likelihood of forest fires</li>
                        <li>greater electricity usage</li>
                        <li>decreased air quality</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Increased sea levels decrease the amount of available land for housing:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Californiaâ€™s coastal sea levels have increased by almost 8 inches in the past century</li>
                        <li>Sea levels are estimated to increase by 20-55 inches by 2100</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Climate change has decreased the amount of available land for housing in California and thus homebuyers are 
                    willing to pay more for available housing, so sellers can raise real estate prices and sell them for more than they 
                    are actually worth.
